# Why am I building an OS.

It feels like less of a question than just some sort of bare fact.

The fact is that I always and naturally wanna dive into the nitty-grity of whatever it is that's caught hold of me. Whether I'm exploring avant-garde concepts in music, reading esoteric philosophy, or studying low-level programming, I always want to understand the subject at hand deeply and broadly.

So of course I would want to build an operating system. This is where all of the magic of computers begins. Without an operating system, there would be no userland, no concurrent processes, no virtualization of memory, no way to interact with the hardware at all (unless I somehow make the leap into hardware engineering [not likely]). Everything that the operating system does well will translate into any other programming project that I want to do well: any real-time venture, anything involving resource management, any work with embedded systems. All of the topics that interest me seem linked to understanding how operating systems work on an intimate level.

I'm doing this more than out of interest: I want to be a good programmer, period. More than that, I want to be an **elite** one: so familiar with the ins and outs of the system that just glancing at kernel code will be like reading the back of a Cheerios box while I munch on my Cheerios. I want to be able to make a meaningful difference in whatever project I work on; and I can't think of a better way to do this than by learning **exactly** what's going on when I power on my system.

I'm hoping to transfer the skills and knowledge I learn with this project into real-time/embedded contexts. I might also try to build an OS in a new language (maybe Zig or Elixir). But first, I want to become a master at operating systems fundamentals, even if this means I have to copy the Linux kernel char for char.

Excited to get deep into the weeds!
